# Avatar

This project was my course work for Computer Systems in the University of Oulu during autumn 2020.

For the course, we were provided a pre-made game for which we were tasked to implement our own controllers using TI SensorTag.
This software detects the tilt of the device for up, down, left and right with the included MPU9250.
The detected commands are then sent wirelessly to the backend of the game allowing control of the in-game avatar.
